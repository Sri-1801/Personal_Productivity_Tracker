ðŸ“Š Personal Productivity Tracker
1. Project Overview
The Personal Productivity Tracker is a data analysis project designed to monitor and evaluate daily productivity habits over a one-month period.
This project demonstrates skills in Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and data storytelling â€” essential for data analyst roles.

2. Dataset Description
The dataset contains 30 days of synthetic but realistic personal productivity data with the following columns:

Column Name	Description
Date	Date of entry
Hours_Worked	Total hours worked in a day
Tasks_Completed	Number of tasks finished
Breaks_Taken	Number of breaks during work
Learning_Hours	Hours spent on skill development
Sleep_Hours	Hours of sleep
Mood_Rating	Mood rating from 1 (lowest) to 10 (highest)

3. Tools & Libraries
Python â€“ Data processing & analysis

Pandas â€“ Data manipulation

Matplotlib / Seaborn â€“ Data visualization

Excel â€“ Dataset storage & initial formatting

4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The following analyses were performed:

Daily Trends â€“ Line charts of Hours Worked and Tasks Completed.

Correlation Analysis â€“ Sleep Hours vs Mood Rating, Learning Hours vs Tasks Completed.

Distribution Analysis â€“ Mood rating histogram.

Top Productivity Days â€“ Identified based on highest task completions.

5. Key Insights
Consistent Work Hours â€“ Average daily work hours were ~6.3, peaking at 8 hours on high-performance days.

Sleep & Mood Connection â€“ Mood ratings of 8+ occurred on days with at least 7 hours of sleep.

Learning Boosts Output â€“ Learning hours between 1.5â€“2.5 correlated with higher task completion rates.

Peak Productivity Dates â€“ Jan 10 & Jan 22 recorded the highest task completions (9 tasks each).

Mood Distribution â€“ Majority of days recorded mood ratings between 7â€“9, indicating consistent positivity.
